## 🎯 What Does This Do?

This pipeline takes your **audio datasets** from HuggingFace and converts them into **tokenized neural codec representations** using NVIDIA's NeMo Nano Codec model.

**Why would you want this?** 🤔

If you're training audio generation models (like TTS, voice cloning, or speech models), you need your audio data in a tokenized format. This pipeline:

- 📦 Downloads audio datasets from HuggingFace
- 🔊 Encodes audio into 4-layer neural codec tokens (super compressed!)
- 💾 Saves everything in efficient JSONL.gz format
- ⚡ Uses all your GPUs for maximum speed
- 🚀 Automatically uploads the final dataset back to HuggingFace

**Perfect for:** Anyone training audio models that need tokenized audio data (like language models for speech, TTS systems, voice conversion, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Super Easy!)

### What You Need

- 🐧 **Linux machine** (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- 🎮 **At least one NVIDIA GPU** (the more, the faster!)
- 🐍 **Python 3.10+**
- ☕ **5-10 minutes** for setup

### Step 1: Run Setup Script

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

That's it! ✨ The script will:
- ✅ Check your Python version
- ✅ Install system dependencies
- ✅ Create a virtual environment
- ✅ Install all Python packages

Grab a coffee, this takes ~5 minutes.

### Step 2: Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(venv)` appear in your terminal prompt.

### Step 3: Login to HuggingFace

You need to authenticate so the pipeline can download and upload datasets:

```bash
# Store credentials (so you don't have to log in every time)
git config --global credential.helper store

# Login to HuggingFace
hf auth login
```

Paste your HuggingFace token when prompted. Get one here: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

### Step 4: Configure Your Pipeline

Edit `config.yaml` to tell the pipeline what to process:

```bash
nano config.yaml
```

See the **Configuration Guide** below for details!

### Step 5: Run the Pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

🎉 Watch the magic happen! You'll see progress bars for each GPU and reader process.

## 📝 Configuration Guide (Easy!)

The `config.yaml` file controls everything. Here's what each part does:

### Example Configuration

```yaml
base_settings:
  audio_codec: nvidia/nemo-nano-codec-22khz-0.6kbps-12.5fps  # The model to use
  num_readers: 8              # How many CPU processes read data (more = faster)
  qsize: 100000               # Queue size (bigger = more RAM, but smoother)
  OUT_DIR: shards             # Where to save the encoded files
  gzip_level: 1               # Compression (1=fast, 9=small files)

hf_datasets:
  - name: your-username/audio-dataset-1   # HuggingFace dataset to process
    sub_name: null                        # Dataset subset/config (or null)
    split: train                          # Which split to use (train/test/validation)
    text_column_name: text                # Name of the text column
    audio_column_name: audio              # Name of the audio column
    speaker_column_name: null             # Speaker column (or null if none)
    add_constant:                         # Add these fields to every sample
      - key: speaker
        value: speaker1
      - key: lang
        value: en

  - name: your-username/audio-dataset-2   # You can add multiple datasets!
    sub_name: clean                       # Example: LibriSpeech has 'clean', 'other' subsets
    split: train                          # Which split to use
    text_column_name: sentences
    audio_column_name: audio
    speaker_column_name: speaker_id       # This dataset has speaker info
    add_constant:
      - key: lang
        value: en
```

### 🔧 What Each Setting Does

#### `base_settings` - Core Configuration

| Setting | What It Does | Recommended Value |

| `audio_codec` | Which NeMo model to use | `nvidia/nemo-nano-codec-22khz-0.6kbps-12.5fps` |
| `num_readers` | CPU processes reading data | 8 (more if you have many CPU cores) |
| `qsize` | Queue buffer size | 100000 (increase if you have lots of RAM) |
| `OUT_DIR` | Output folder | `shards` |
| `gzip_level` | Compression level | 1 (fast) or 9 (small files) |
| `buffer_size` | Write buffer size | 16777216 (16MB) |
| `lines_per_file` | Samples per output file | 50000 |
| `load_dataset_num_proc` | Parallel loading | 20 (more = faster loading) |

#### `save_settings` - Where to Save

| Setting | What It Does | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `local` | Save to local disk | `train_dataset` or `null` to skip |
| `hf_upload` | Upload to HuggingFace | `username/dataset-name` or `null` to skip |

#### `hf_datasets` - Your Datasets

Each dataset entry has:

| Field | What It Does | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| `name` | HuggingFace dataset name | `openslr/librispeech_asr` |

## 🎓 For Model Trainers

### Why Use This Pipeline?

If you're training audio generation models, you need your audio in a **tokenized** format. This pipeline:

1. **Converts raw audio → tokens** using state-of-the-art neural codecs
2. **Compresses 22kHz audio** down to just **0.6 kbps** (12.5 tokens/second!)
3. **Preserves quality** through hierarchical 4-layer encoding
4. **Handles large datasets** with automatic sharding and compression

### What Models Need This?

- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** models
- 🎤 **Voice cloning** systems
- 🔄 **Voice conversion** models
- 🧠 **Language models for speech** (like AudioLM, VALL-E)
- 🎵 **Music generation** models

### How to Use the Output

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load your processed dataset
dataset = load_dataset("your-username/your-dataset")

# Each sample has:
# - text: the transcription
# - nano_layer_1-4: codec tokens (4 layers)
# - encoded_len: sequence length
# - any metadata you added (speaker, lang, etc.)

for sample in dataset:
    text = sample['text']
    tokens_layer1 = sample['nano_layer_1']  # Shape: [encoded_len]
    tokens_layer2 = sample['nano_layer_2']
    # Use these tokens to train your model!
```

### Understanding the Codec

- **4 layers** = hierarchical encoding (coarse → fine details)
- **12.5 fps** = 12.5 tokens per second of audio
- **22kHz** = input audio sample rate
- **0.6 kbps** = extremely compressed!

## 🔧 Advanced Options

### Processing Multiple Datasets

Just add more entries to `hf_datasets`:

```yaml
hf_datasets:
  - name: dataset1
    # ... config ...
  - name: dataset2
    # ... config ...
  - name: dataset3
    # ... config ...
```

They'll all be processed sequentially and merged into one final dataset!

### Adding Metadata

Use `add_constant` to tag your data:

```yaml
add_constant:
  - key: dataset_source
    value: librispeech
  - key: lang
    value: en
  - key: quality
    value: clean
```

This helps when training multi-dataset models!

### GPU Utilization

The pipeline automatically uses **all available GPUs**. Each GPU:
- Gets its own worker process
- Processes samples from a shared queue
- Writes to separate shard files

More GPUs = faster processing! 🚀

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "No CUDA devices found"

Make sure you have:
1. NVIDIA GPU installed
2. NVIDIA drivers installed
3. CUDA toolkit installed

Check with: `nvidia-smi`

### "Permission denied" on setup.sh

Run: `chmod +x setup.sh`

### HuggingFace login fails

Get a token from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

Make sure you select "Write" permissions!

### Pipeline runs slowly

- Increase `num_readers` (more CPU processes)
- Increase `load_dataset_num_proc` (faster loading)
- Check GPU utilization with `nvidia-smi`

### Out of memory

- Decrease `qsize` (smaller queue)
- Decrease `num_readers` (fewer parallel processes)
- Process smaller datasets
